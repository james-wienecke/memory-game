# JavaScript Practice 1: Memory Game
by James Wienecke (james-wienecke, james.a.wienecke@gmail.com)

## Summary:
This is part of a series of projects I intend to work on to become a better JavaScript programmer. I followed [this course from freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc) but have made changes to their suggested code for my own purposes.
This specific project is my attempt to create a basic form of the classic "Concentration" memory game.

## How to try it out:
1. Download the project
2. Open index.html in your favorite web browser!

## How to play Concentration:
1. When the game starts, there will be a grid of cards in a "face down" state. When cards are "face down", the backs of all cards are identical.
2. Clicking on a card will flip it "face up", which reveals the face of the card. There are two of each card face mixed throughout the grid.
3. While the first card is "face up", clicking a second card will flip that one "face up" as well.
4. If the two "face up" cards match, they are removed from play. If the two "face up" cards are different, they will both be flipped "face down" again and remain in play.
5. Continue flipping pairs of cards "face up" to match their faces until all cards have been removed from play.
6. Try to match all the cards in as few moves as possible! Good luck!
