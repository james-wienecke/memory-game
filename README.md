# JavaScript Practice 1: Memory Game
by James Wienecke (james-wienecke, james.a.wienecke@gmail.com)

## Summary:
This is part of a series of projects I intend to work on to become a better JavaScript programmer. I followed [this course from freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc) but have made changes to their suggested code for my own purposes.

## Software used in this project:
* github
* git (command line)
* Google Chrome
* vim
* intelliJ IDEA
